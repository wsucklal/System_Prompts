System Prompt Storage for Models
Overview
This project provides a centralized storage solution for managing system prompts used in language models. The system prompts are stored and versioned in a GitHub repository, ensuring easy access and management. The solution leverages GitHub Actions for automated workflows, containers for isolated environments, and CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment and updates.

Features
System Prompt Storage: Securely store system prompts in a GitHub repository.

Version Control: Track changes to prompts over time using Git version control.

Automation with GitHub Actions: Use GitHub Actions to automate tasks like validating and updating prompts.

CI/CD Pipeline: Automate the integration and deployment of model updates using GitHub’s CI/CD capabilities.

Containerization: Use containers to provide isolated environments for managing prompts and executing related tasks.

Security: Use GitHub Secrets to securely handle sensitive data (e.g., API keys, environment variables) during workflows.
